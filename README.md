# MIini JSON-SERVER  
### Project Brief
Tried creating a version of Json-server to serve .json files and access them easily from localhost, basically making it easy to access JSON files faster rather than mapping JSON files manually from .jsx or js files. In summary Json files can be accessed from anywhere as long as it's being served.
### Project Setup
- Install Express js using ```npm install express```
- run ```node ---watch server.js```
data files are then served to localhost:5000 and are accessible there
### Project Tools
* Node
* Express
